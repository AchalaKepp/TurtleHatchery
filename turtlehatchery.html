        <p>
            The turtle population of Sri Lanka is one of the most remarkable and significant in the world. The country's coastal areas act as crucial nesting grounds for several turtle species, including the Loggerhead, Green, Olive Ridley, Hawksbill, and Leatherback turtles. Sri Lanka's dedication to conservation efforts, such as establishing protected areas and implementing sustainable practices, has played an indispensable role in protecting these endangered creatures. The local communities, along with a sizeable contribution from organizations and government initiatives, actively participate in turtle conservation projects, including hatcheries and beach patrols. Through these combined efforts, the turtle population in Sri Lanka has witnessed a gradual recovery, displaying the positive impact of dedicated conservation measures on the survival and preservation of these magnificent sea creatures</p>

                <p>Out of the seven species of sea turtles, six are endangered by human activities. The consumption of these turtles and the dumping of wastes and toxins in water bodies and other environments adaptive to the turtles threaten their existence. </p>

        <h1>Turtle Types</h1>
        <p>Sri Lanka is home to a diverse range of turtle species that inhabit its coastal waters and beaches. The country boasts five main types of turtles: </p>
        
        <ol class="turtlelist">
            <li>Loggerhead Turtle</li>
            <li>Olive Ridley Turtle</li>
            <li>Leatherback Turtle</li>
            <li>Green Sea Turtle</li>
            <li>Hawksbill Turtle</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The Olive Ridley, Loggerhead, Green, Hawksbill, and Leatherback turtles. The Loggerhead turtle, recognized by its large head and powerful jaws, is a less common sight but occasionally nests on Sri Lankan shores. The Olive Ridley turtle, known for its olive-colored shell, is the most common species found in Sri Lanka. The Green turtle, named after its greenish-colored fat, is another popular species that nests along the country's coastlines. The Hawksbill turtle, with its characteristic pointed beak and beautifully patterned shell, is severely endangered but can still be found in Sri Lankan waters. Lastly, the Leatherback turtle, the largest of all sea turtles, occasionally visits Sri Lanka's shores during its migration. These diverse turtle species contribute to the rich marine ecosystem of Sri Lanka and are a demonstration to the country's importance as a nesting and foraging habitat for these magnificent sea creatures</p>
